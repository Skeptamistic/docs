The staff is the set of employees of the restaurant. Each staff member fulfills at least one role (set of tasks).

The staff flow shown here includes the Expeditor role and the role of station-specific staff. The names of stations indicate the types of dishes that the staff members prepare at that station, such as hot, cold, and beverages.

## 1. Show new orders

The system shows a patron's new order on the Expeditor's UI. To do so, the Expeditor's client fetches new orders by using the `orders` endpoint.

An order is considered new if it is placed on the current day. In this example, "current day" is interpreted as any day on or after the first day of the calendar year.

### Request

The client sends a `GET` request to the `orders`endpoint with a filter for the current day and orders with a status of `Received`:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  '{server url}/orders?sort=priority&order=asc&fields=table_number|status|priority|dish_ids&filter=status.eq~Received|created_at.gt~2025-01-01'
```

### Response

For a successful request, the server responds with a `200` status code and body of results as specified by the request. For this example, three orders are returned.

The `status` value in the response can be considered redundant because the filter in the request specifies that `status` be equal to `Received`.

The `priority` value is useful in the Prioritization step of the process.

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "685895df7e453310d06b1693",
      "table_number": 7,
      "status": "Received",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "6861993b6c98c51d5e854882",
      "table_number": 18,
      "status": "Received",
      "priority": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "685895df7e453310d06b16b5",
      "table_number": 13,
      "status": "Received",
      "priority": 4
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 3
}
```

## 2. Adjust order priorities

In this step, the expeditor can adjust order priorities. Priority values are in the range 1-5 inclusive, 1 the highest priority. The default priority value is 3.

Changing the priority of an order requires the order `id` to be included in a `PUT`request to the `orders` endpoint.

In the following example, the priority of order `6861993b6c98c51d5e854882` in the results of the previous step is set to `2`.

### Request

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'https://{server url}/orders/6861993b6c98c51d5e854882' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {bearer token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "dish_ids": ["685895df7e453310d06b1684"],
  "priority": 2,
  "status": "Received"
}'
```

### Response

For a successful request, the server responds with a `200` status code and body of results as specified by the request.

```json
{
  "id": "6861993b6c98c51d5e854882",
  "created_at": "2025-06-29T19:51:23.372Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-06-29T20:18:14.896Z",
  "scheduled_at": null,
  "table_number": 18,
  "status": "Received",
  "priority": 2,
  "dish_ids": [
    "685895df7e453310d06b1684"
  ],
  "special_requests": "No peanuts."
}
```

## 3. Start Preparation

After the expeditor makes sure that order priorities are correct, the expeditor starts the preparation process for an order. To do so, the expeditor sets the order status to `In Progress`.

### Request

Setting an order status to `In Progress` requries a `PUT` request to the `orders` endpoint with the order `id`.

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'https://{server url}/orders/6861993b6c98c51d5e854882' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {bearer token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "dish_ids": ["685895df7e453310d06b1684"],
  "priority": 2,
  "status": "In Progress"
}'
```

### Response

For a successful request, the server responds with a `200` status code and body of results as specified by the request.

```json
{
  "id": "6861993b6c98c51d5e854882",
  "created_at": "2025-06-29T19:51:23.372Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-06-29T20:20:41.763Z",
  "scheduled_at": null,
  "table_number": 18,
  "status": "In Progress",
  "priority": 2,
  "dish_ids": [
    "685895df7e453310d06b1684"
  ],
  "special_requests": "No peanuts."
}
```

## 4. Order Preparation by Stations

Each dish in an order that is `In Progress` must be assigned to a station, such as cold, hot, or beverages. The client machine at each station shows the dishes that are assigned to that station.

For the station client to show a dish, the client uses the `orders` endpoint, specifies the order `id`, and then queries `dishes`.

### Request

The request uses `GET` with this endpoint: `/orders/{id}/dishes` .

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://{server url}/orders/6861993b6c98c51d5e854882/dishes?sort=station&order=asc&fields=name%7Cstation%7Cingredients&offset=0' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

### Response

For a successful request, the server responds with a `200` status code and body of results as specified by the request. The response includes every dish that is in the order. In this example, the system returns one orders, for Prosecco. For the next step in the process, the client must store the dish ID locally

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "685895df7e453310d06b1684",
      "name": "Prosecco",
      "ingredients": [
        {
          "ingredient_id": "685895df7e453310d06b15c7",
          "is_essential": true,
          "_id": "685895df7e453310d06b1685"
        },
        {
          "ingredient_id": "685895df7e453310d06b15df",
          "is_essential": false,
          "_id": "685895df7e453310d06b1686"
        },
        {
          "ingredient_id": "685895df7e453310d06b15db",
          "is_essential": true,
          "_id": "685895df7e453310d06b1687"
        },
        {
          "ingredient_id": "685895df7e453310d06b15e8",
          "is_essential": true,
          "_id": "685895df7e453310d06b1688"
        }
      ],
      "station": "beverages"
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 1
}
```

## 5. Display Dish Ingredients

The station client must show to the station staff the ingredients for each dish.

To show the ingredients of a dish, the client uses the `dishes` endpoint with the dish `id` (from the previous step in the process) and then queries `ingredients`.

### Request

The request uses `GET` with this endpoint: `/dishes/{id}/ingredients`.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://{server url}/dishes/685895df7e453310d06b1684/ingredients?sort=name&order=asc&fields=name%7Cin_stock_qty&limit=10&offset=0' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

### Response

For a successful request, the server responds with a `200` status code and body of results as specified by the request. The response includes every ingredient that is in the dish that the request specifies.

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "685895df7e453310d06b15df",
      "name": "Bread Crumbs",
      "in_stock_qty": 40
    },
    {
      "id": "685895df7e453310d06b15db",
      "name": "Chicken Stock",
      "in_stock_qty": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "685895df7e453310d06b15c7",
      "name": "Chili Flakes",
      "in_stock_qty": 20
    },
    {
      "id": "685895df7e453310d06b15e8",
      "name": "Chili Flakes",
      "in_stock_qty": 7
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 4
}
```

## 6. Ready for Assembly

When the staff at a station complete their part of an order, they mark it as `Ready for Assembly` on the station client machine.

When all of the dishes in an order are ready, the client-app logic notifies the expeditor. No API calls are required for this step.

## 7. Order Assembly

In the order assembly step, the expeditor brings together the order dishes from each station that prepared at least one dish for the order.

After the expeditor completes this work, the expeditor changes the order status. For table-side orders, the `status` changes to `On the Way`.  For takeaway orders, the expeditor changes the `status` to `Ready for Pickup`.

### Request

To implement the change of status by the expeditor, the client uses a `PUT` request with the `orders` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'https://crispy-potato-g75r4x66qx6fwrxg-80.app.github.dev/orders/6861993b6c98c51d5e854882' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer a1732455-42cf-4d24-a956-84adc847c0ca' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "dish_ids": ["685895df7e453310d06b1684"],
  "priority": 2,
  "status": "On the Way"
}'
```

### Response

For a successful request, the server responds with a `200` status code with the response body that show the updated status.

```json
{
  "id": "6861993b6c98c51d5e854882",
  "created_at": "2025-06-29T19:51:23.372Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-06-29T20:29:33.724Z",
  "scheduled_at": null,
  "table_number": 18,
  "status": "On the Way",
  "priority": 2,
  "dish_ids": [
    "685895df7e453310d06b1684"
  ],
  "special_requests": "No peanuts."
}
```
